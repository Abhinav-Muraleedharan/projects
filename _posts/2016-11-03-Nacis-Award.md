I'm psyched to put out that a map that I worked on last spring won the North American Cartographic Society Best Dynamic Map award at their annual conference a couple weeks back.  It was a blast working with Starr and Meghan on this project and well worth the late nights. Looking forward to more interactive mapping coming up.  If you've got something you want to map -- let me know!
