              <p><strong>Within Minutes - Madison</strong> is an application I developed during the #UWCart 2017 Design Challenge to facilitate decision making about community demographics in the context of city planning. One goal of the 2017 challenge was to determine where a new community center should go to best serve Madisonians. I build this tool to reveal community demographics at the parcel level within a specified walking distance of a hypothesized new community center. The planners can click a parcel and get parcel characteristics, public infrastructure, and more within a specified time buffer. This simplifies the task of undertaking a GIS analysis of official proposed sites for new centers and allows more sites to be considered -- and hopefully improving community center distribution in the city.

              <br ><br >
              I built this tool during a one-day exercise in March, 2017. I am (slowly) working to bring it into the world for real.

              <br /><br />
              This tool is built entirely on public, open-source data provided by the City of Madison.
