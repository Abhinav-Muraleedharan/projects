              <p>This is a simple plugin for <a href='https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/'>DC.js</a> and <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/'>Mapbox-GL</a>that allows you to integrate mapbox vector tiles into your DC.js dashboards. While developing <a href="http://scottsfarley.com/IceAgeMapper">Ice Age Mapper</a>, I realized I wanted to improve performance and modernize the application by using vector tiles and the mapbox-gl library. As the emerging standard for web maps, I thought this was an important conversion to make while developing the visualization tool for the next generation of paleoecologists. However, IAM was already heavily dependent on the crossfilter.js and dc.js libraries, which enable efficient filtering and graphing of multidimensional data. While Leaflet has a plugin for dc.js, mapbox didn't. So, I made this library. It was a fun experience -- one that I got really into -- and was my first time building a javascript module.
