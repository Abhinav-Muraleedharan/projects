    			<p class='italic' id='titleText'>The recent civil conflict in Syria has displaced millions, forcing families from their homes to seek shelter from violence both within Syria and around the Middle East and Europe.  
    				While countries worldwide are accepting asylum applications for these refugees, more than half of American state governors have expressed opposition to allowing migrants into their states.
    				Perhaps their reluctance is due, in part, to the fact that the American media tends to cover the conflict and the violence within Syria's borders in more depth than the plight of those feeling the war, 
    				biasing the public towards thinking of all Syrians as dangerous and radical and a threat to American security. 
    				This analysis looks at the coverage of the situation by The <i>New York Times</i>, an American journalism outlet
    				with a readership of over 60 million visitors per month, to investigate the relationship between the number of refugees arriving in a country and the the depth of the coverage about that country in the <i>Times.</i>

    			While tensions have long run high in Syria, data from the United Nations suggests that the great migration out of the country began in the summer of 2012. 
    			The civil war between the regime governement of Bashar al-Assad and rebel groups that began in 2011 was compounded by the rise to power of the Islamic State group in early 2014, increasing the rate of migration
    			 out of the country and creating millions of internally displaced people (IDPs) within country itself. 
    			 To make matters worse, a proxy war between the United States, backing the rebel groups, and the Russians, who have shown strong support for the Assad regime, 
    			  emerged in 2015 with both nations carrying out air campaigns in recent months. While both nations claim to be acting to stem the advance of 
    			 the Islamic State, unspeakable attrocities by all sides and humanitarian conditions in the country have led the U.N. and others to decry the situation
    			  as <i class='large'>"the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II."</i> </p>
				<br />
				<p>At this time, the governors of 31 U.S. states have issued statements indicating their unwillingness to accept the resettlement of Syrians within their states. 
					While allowing people into the country is technically a federal power granted by the Consitution, and the Obama adminsitration has expressed strong support
					for allowing additional migrants into the United States, states' reluctance to comply with federal programs make the U.S. an unwelcoming desitnation for Syrian migrants.
					Though carrying little legal weight, the words of Mississippi Governor Phil Bryan capture the sentiment of many:
					<blockquote>
					<i>"I will do everything humanly possible to stop any plans from the Obama administration to put Syrian refugees in Mississippi... </i>
						<i class='large'>The policy of bringing these individuals into the country is not only misguided, it is extremely dangerous..."</i></blockquote></p>

    			<p>Maps showing the mass migration routes of Syrians out of their home country into and Europe, are commonplace in the English-language media, and can be found in popular sources such as 
    				<a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/world/20131130boat/web-s645-BOAT.jpg">The New York Times</a>,
    				<a href="http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/55eef3d49dd7cc10008b8b68-1102-1245/migrant%20route%201.png">Business Insider</a>, and 
    				<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150919-data-points-refugees-migrants-maps-human-migrations-syria-world/">National Geographic.</a>
    				While effective in showing relative direction, these flow maps often do not differentiate between the relative number of migrants that choose each route, and suggest a tendency of the migrants to choose a 
    				route through the Balkan states. While there are plenty of heart-wrenching accounts covering both the obstacles faced by individual migrants and their families, and the crisis as a whole, 
    				these stories seem to tend to focus on those migrants seeking asylum in Europe, 
    				rather than those looking for refuge in neighboring Jordan, Turkey, or Iraq.  These neighboring states, depsite having their own political and civil unrest, have taken in nearly an order of magnitude more refugees
    				than states in the European Union, both in refugee camps and in urban and informal resettlement projects.</p>  
    				<p>To address shortcomings of these prevalent maps, this article sets out to understand three questions: Which nations are the most important players in accepting the most refugees?  
    				Which states are most prevalent in the American media coverage?  And, are these countries the same?  Perhaps if we can answer these questions, we can get a better sense of how Syrians are represented in the news delivered to a large portion of the American public.

    			<h2>All the News That's Fit to Print</h2>
    			<p>To assess the relationship between news coverage and migrant arrival rates, a quantitative textual content analysis of the
    				articles in the <i>Times</i> was done for two time periods in 2015.  These time periods, January through June, and September and October, are periods for which
    				migration patterns were particularly clear, and for which there is reliable arrival data from the United Nations.  The textual analysis was completed using this method:
    					<ol>
    						<li><b>Search </b><span class='text-muted'>Using the <i>Times</i> Article Search API, articles that contained mention of the word Syria in either their
    							title, byline, or body were identified.</span></li>
    						<li><b>Analyze </b><span class='text-muted'>Using a python script, the full text of all articles that were maintained on the <i>Times</i> 
    							website was downloaded and searched for mentions of U.N. recognized country names.</span></li>
    						<li><b>Resample </b><span class='text-muted'>Daily counts were downsampled to either monthly or weekly resolution to facilitate analysis.</span></li>
    					</ol></p>
    			<p>In total, the analysis covered <b>3,890 articles</b> over 182 days containing <b>238,805 unique words</b>. This is a smaller fraction of the <i>Times'</i> actual coverage, due to removal of assets from the website,
    				however, it is still a signficantly large sample size.<br /></p>
    				
    			<p>The refugee arrival data was compiled from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees agency website. While the agency maintains
    			state-of-the-art information portals that support visualization and exploration, it was difficult to find the underlying data sources.
    			Data was eventually obtained by reverse engineering the website's source code.
    			</p><br />
    			<p>The analysis was split into three geographic regions:
    				<ol>
    					<li> <b>The Western Mediterranean</b> <span class='text-muted'>Spain, Italy, Malta</span></li> 
    					<i>January through June</i>
    					<li> <b>The Balkans</b> <span class='text-muted'>Greece, Macedonia, Slovenia, Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Austria </span></li>

					meaning thousands of Syrians pass through these routes, either seeking asylum in these states or in other parts of Europe.  Nearly all Syrians en route to Spain enter in Melilla, a small 
					Spanish holding on the northern Coast of Africa.  Those taking the route through Italy and Malta brave people smugglers, dangerously overcrowded and unseaworth boats,
					and unpredictable weather to cross the Mediterranean Sea. The numbers here are derived from UNHCR statistics that include country of origin data.

  				<p>On October 17, Hungary sealed its border with Serbia with a razor-wire fence, allowing entry only at designated entry points. 
  					Acting unilaterally, the Hungarian governement thus closed a major thoroughfare for migrants through eastern Europe to Germany and other countries with high rates of granting asylum.
  					  Prior to this event, migrants were able to move more or less freely about the Balkan states, and national border crossings, particularly into the European Union, were not highly regulated. 
  					  Following this event, which Hungary claimed to do for the safety of its inhabitants, migrants were diverted to the west, and forced to cross Croatia and 
  					  Slovenia. </p>

    							the most mentioned country of all those analyzed, garnering an average of 68 mentions per month.  
    							Iraq struggles with its own violence -- upwards of 14,000 civilians have been killed there in 2015 alone.  
    							</li>
    						<li><b>Hungary </b>Hungary received the second most news coverage, with approximately 61 mentions per month.  However, much of this coverage was likely due
    							to the political activities around closing the Serbian border, rather than the humanitarian situation, as evidenced by its lower average influx rate and the border closing.
    							 </li>
    					</ol>
    					If the news is more likely to cover political maneuvering and hostile acts in Hungary, Iraq, and other countries, then American readers will undoubtedly
    					be more likely to conflate this state of affairs with Syrian refugees themselves.

    			<p>The Syrian migrant crisis is not over.  While influx rates of Syrian refugees have stablized in some countries, many countries, especially those in the Middle East, are far over their capacity to support these
    			people.  Several million people remain displaced within Syria, and many may be forced to leave as the civil war continues to unfold.  </p>
    			<p>It is important to remember that these refugees are not terrorists.  They're families escaping the senseless violence of terrorists.  
    				Their homes -- their lives -- have been totally destroyed to the point of no return.
    				As a wealthy nation, as a a nation that does not suffer from widespread civil unrest, we, as Americans, should be doing our part to alleviate the situation to any degree possible.
    				One step in this direction is for <i>The New York Times</i>, a primary source of news for many Americans, to stop glorifying the violence and the terror in the Middle East
    				and to start consciously humanizing the refugees, both in the content of their stories and the depth of their coverage.
