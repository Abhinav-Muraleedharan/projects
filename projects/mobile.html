    				an Anti-Syrian Bias in the American Public</h3>
    			<p class='italic' id='titleText'>The recent civil conflict in Syria has displaced millions, forcing families from their homes to seek shelter from violence both within Syria and around the Middle East and Europe.  
    				While countries worldwide are accepting asylum applications for these refugees, more than half of American state governors have expressed opposition to allowing migrants into their states.
    				Perhaps their reluctance is due, in part, to the fact that the American media tends to cover the conflict and the violence within Syria's borders in more depth than the plight of those feeling the war, 
    				biasing the public towards thinking of all Syrians as dangerous and radical and a threat to American security. 
    				This analysis looks at the coverage of the situation by The <i>New York Times</i>, an American journalism outlet
    				with a readership of over 60 million visitors per month, to investigate the relationship between the number of refugees arriving in a country and the the depth of the coverage about that country in the <i>Times.</i>
