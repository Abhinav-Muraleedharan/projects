      Hi! I am a second year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison studying Cartography and GIS.
      I am interested in developing inuitive, engaging, fun, and useful geospatial web applications that improve decision making.
      I love to program, usually in JavaScript and sometimes in python. I spend most of my time building things -- you can see some of them
      <a href="http://github.com/scottsfarley93">on my GitHub</a>.
      I am interested in climate change and its impact on biodiversity, humans, and natural disasters. My Master's thesis project looks at ways to
    optimize computer models for predicting future species range shifts so we can be better prepared to adapt to changing patterns of biodiversity.
    I think that data-driven interfaces and machine learning tools will be able to guide and improve the way we respond to the
    (irreversible) changes in the Earth System. When I'm not at my desk, I like to compete in endurance skiing and running races, rock climb, and travel.
  <br /><br /><br />
  This website showcases a selection of my projects, houses my <a href="#posts">research blog</a>, and is a platform for many of my front-end code projects. Have a look around!

      </h2>
      <div class=''>
        <p>Last week I have the opportunity to present a short talk at the Digital Data in Paleontological Research, sponsored by iDigBio in Berkeley, CA. It was a great opportunity to get to know a community of people working with the same types of data as I am, but tackling totally different problems. The goals of my talk were (1) to cast Neotoma and PBDB as excellent additions to modeling pipelines and (2) to introduce my PhD research on reconstructing past land cover. Most of the folks were verebrate paleontologists, and many use image, CT, or 3d databases, rather than the paleobiodiversity databases I am familiar with, so I thought it was important to highlight the ability of these databases to serve a key role on modeling pipelines. Here are the slides from my talk.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, especially when working with climate data, it is necessary to work with NetCDFs (Network Common Data Format – standard data packaging for scientific data).  While NetCDF is good for data distribution, storage, and provenance, it is less good for working into standard raster data processing workflows. If you’re used to working with Tiffs or JPEGs, the following command might be helpful, assuming you have gdal installed on your machine.</p>

It was a lot to cover in less than half an hour, so I wanted to write up a quick blog post about it too. To lead the discussion, I created this infographic that outlines the components of a data service, and how they might relate to one another.</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago, I posted about Big Data in the field of ecology, specifically biodiversity informatics, where I looked at the holdings of the Neotoma Paleoecological Database and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). I made some comparisons between the two databases, though the units of scale were different. In Neotoma, I used the number of <em>datasets</em> that had been submitted, while for GBIF, I commented on the number of <em>occurrences</em>.  These are two fundamentally different units, so I set out to resolve the issue and find out how many occurrences there are in Neotoma.</p>

In the Williams Lab, we’re working with datasets that are sometimes called ‘Big Data’ in talks by <a href="https://twitter.com/iceageecologist">@iceageecolgist</a> and others, housed in databases like <a href="http://neotomadb.org">Neotoma</a>, <a href="http://gbif.org">the Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a>, and the <a href="http://paleobiodb.org">Paleobiology Database</a>.

      </h2>
      <div class=''>
        <p>One of the features Rob suggested I add to Ice Age Mapper during our last meeting was a dynamic url that would record the current state of the application, and could thus be shared between users. I took a stab at that last week, and got it working pretty well.  I thought it would be a lot of re-coding from the ground up, but it turns out that most of what I had written previously could be easily converted to load a URL string.  My application only generates a shareable URL when the user clicks the ‘Share’ button, but in theory, the app could easily be modified to generate a new URL each time an action was taken.  I think this would actually <strong><em>Not</em></strong> be a good idea, because it would mean there would be an entry in the user’s web history for each action they took inside of the application, meaning they would have to click the back button like a million times if they messed up.  Good to know support exists for that though.</p>

      <div class=''>
        <p>I’ve made significant progress in getting a couple of Google’s computers to do my bidding (aka my thesis), in an automated way, so I thought I would share my experience setting up my cluster, and, specifically, the configuration of computing nodes and database/control nodes.  My setup draws on a bit on the design of larger systems like Hadoop, which create frameworks for massively large and distributed fault-tolerant systems.  In short, I have one Master Node that hosts a database and a control script, and a pool of compute nodes that are fault-tolerant and designed only for computing.  The compute nodes don’t have to know anything about the progress of the entire project and can handle being shut down mid-run, and the control node doesn’t have to know anything about the simulations being computed.</p>

        <p>In my work, I have several times encountered the need to run a script for an extended period of time, or as a daemon (always running as a service).  Whether you’re on your own personal computer or SSHed into a virtual machine in the cloud, managing processes that take a long time can be annoying. If you finish your work day and close your laptop, you’re going to stop your script.  In the cloud (or I guess on a desktop/personal server too) you can take a couple steps to run scripts as services that will not stop when you end your work day.  There are a couple of ways of doing it that I’ve found.  Here are two that matched my needs.</p>

      <div class=''>
        <p>In continuing my meditations on beginning to use the Google Cloud Computing platform, this post will describe the use of startup and shutdown scripts. If you want to start multiple instances that are all the same in terms of programs, data, etc (but perhaps of different size), you have two options. First, you could save your fully configured machine as an image, or more likely, as a snapshot.  Booting with this configuration is easy, just select the option from the menu when starting the new instance. Proceeding in this way has several potential drawbacks, however.  Most notably, it is very difficult to keep everything updated with this method.  Unless you manually update the snapshot pretty often, your software is going to be out of date.  Moreover, if you decide to make a small change in the scripts or programs you’re running on the instance, you will need to make an update to the snapshot.</p>

        <p>Part of the reason that I am keeping this blog is to keep a record of the things I’ve done
and my thought process in doing them so that when it comes time to write up my thesis,
I will have a better recollection of what was going through my head. The other reason
is to perhaps help someone out there struggling similar problems that I went through.
I think that my adventures in the Google Cloud Platform are a good example of this –
Google’s Cloud Platform is acknowledged to be slightly less mature than some of its competitors, like AWS.
Because of this, there are fewer stackexchange questions, blogs posts, etc that can help guide
basic setup.  I do think that Google’s documentation and tutorials are better than Amazon’s –
more accessible, better written – but it can be hard to figure out what you need to
be doing if you’re not a cloud professional.  So I’ll document some of the hard steps
I encountered in this ongoing set of posts.</p>

        <h3>Using APIs and Data Services</h3>
<p>This is the second installment in my series about finding data from new and different sources for use in your cartography or GIS projects.  Last time I discussed looking through existing source code to find hidden datasets that might be useful. Today, I will walk through using an API service to tap into an organization’s database.  As a simple google search will reveal, there are other resources, blogs, and tutorials out there that talk about how to use an API as a data source, but I will focus particularly on converting data from an API into a useful spatial data format that can be used in mapping and analysis.  Tons of APIs have spatial data (usually latitude and longitude) attached to their responses, its just a matter of finding the data service and massaging it into the right format.</p>
<h4>What is an API?</h4>
<p>An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and methods that define how two computers should talk to each other.  An API is a documented set of building blocks (of code) that define how an existing application works.  A programmer can put these blocks together to extend the existing program, or create a new app that uses portions of the existing program.  Consider <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.  Twitter is super popular, and a lot of people use it for various things – documenting every facet of their daily lives, reporting news, <a href="http://chrisscheele.com/">observing disasters and severe weather</a>, etc.  To build the platform, Twitter needed to make a whole bunch of computers talk to each other. When a user writes a tweet, it is sent to twitter’s central database, where it is stored, and then pushed back out to other clients.  Multiply this by Twitter’s &gt;310 million users, both reading and writing tweets, and you have a lot of clients that need to communicate with minimal friction.</p>

      <div class=''>
        <p>I was recently tasked with writing a formal proposal for my thesis as the final paper in one of my courses.  The final draft of the proposal was 21 single spaced pages.  I figured I would write a shorter and perhaps more accessible summary of the work I am starting on so those of you out there that are curious what I’m working on don’t have to wade through that.  If you do want to see the real thing, references, equations, and all, you can find it <a href="http://scottsfarley.com/assets/Farley_Thesis_Proposal_final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4>In One Sentence:</h4>
<p>I am attempting to develop a well-performing predictive model that, given a species distribution model user’s goals and requirements, determines the optimal computing configuration for that modeling routine by balancing the time spent modeling with the cost of the computing equipment used.</p>

      </h2>
      <div class=''>
        <p>When running statistical models, like multiple linear regression or generalized linear models, it is typically not a good idea to use multiple predictor variables that are highly correlated with one another, as it may result in an unstable final model. This guideline also applies to many of various flavors of species distribution models (SDMs), which take in two or more (usually climatic) predictor variables to model a species response to environmental gradients.  Given modeled climate output, the SDM models can be used to estimate the probability of a species occurring in a different time period, say at the last glacial maximum – 22,000 years ago–, or in 2100, once humans have contributed several degrees to the earth’s temperature.  While these models differ in their statistical techniques, most behave a little like multiple regression, where a set of predict variables are combined in some parametric or non-parametric way to estimate the response as a function of these inputs.  Thus, just like in a standard regression, using highly correlated climatic predictor variables can  contribute to instability in the modeled response.  This post describes the methods I chose to identify correlated variables and choose the ones I wanted to remain in my study.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, it can be hard to find the data we want.  We spend hours looking in all our normal places.  We cruise the census bureau, hit the EPA’s data portal, and browse UW’s collection of geospatial resources. If you have a topic or a storyline in mind, it can be really frustrating to find that you can’t find the right data.  In most cases, the data you seek is actually out there, it might just be a little harder to find that you might hope.  I’ll discuss a couple of techniques I use from time to time when I find myself in this situation.  This is my first blog post, so stay with me.</p>
