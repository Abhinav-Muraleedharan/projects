I am an engineer at [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com), a trail runner, a rock climber, a photography enthusiast, a map nerd, and an endurance ski racer. At work, I prototype new systems using Mapbox's location data to understand how people move around. If I'm not at work, I'm usually doing something in the mountains.

Want to get in touch? Drop me a line at [scott.farley@mapbox.com](mailto:scott.farley@mapbox.com).
